# Plant_Disease_Detection_Intel_Hackathon
This code is a tensorflow implementation of training and evaluating model on the PlantVillage dataset. The dataset consists of images of diseased and healthy plant leaves. The model is trained on a subset of the dataset, and then evaluated on a separate test set. The trained model is saved as a .h5 file.

## Requirements

•	TensorFlow==2.9.1

•	Keras

•	Matplotlib

•	dev cloud for oneAPI

•	PlantVillage dataset

## Installation
